**Network and Internet
Networking Labs and Report ‚Äì Cisco Packet Tracer**

This repository contains a collection of networking lab activities and a final report completed as part of the Networks and the Internet module. The exercises were carried out using Cisco Packet Tracer and focus on fundamental to intermediate networking concepts, device configuration, and network security.

üîπ Lab Activities**

Each lab activity focuses on a specific networking concept and includes step-by-step configuration, verification, and reflection.

**Activity 1** ‚Äì **Basic Router Setup**

Initial Cisco ISR router configuration.

Securing administrative access with hostname, enable password/secret, password encryption, and console access. 


**Activity 2** ‚Äì **Basic Switch Setup & Telnet Configuration**

Switch hostname configuration.

Message of the Day (MOTD) banner.

Securing privileged EXEC mode with encrypted password.

Console and Telnet remote management configuration. 



**Activity 3** ‚Äì **Configuring Switch Interfaces**

Access port setup (speed, duplex).

VLAN assignment and connectivity testing.

Trunk connections between multiple switches.

Network validation through pings and Packet Tracer‚Äôs assessment tools. 



**Activity 4** ‚Äì **Static Routing Configuration**

Setting up static routes between three routers.

Manual next-hop routing for inter-network communication.

Verification with successful ping tests across routers. 



**Activity 5** ‚Äì **Default Static Route Configuration**

Multi-router topology with five routers.

Implementation of default static routes to simplify routing decisions.

Network connectivity verification across all routers. 



**Activity 6** ‚Äì **VLAN & VTP Configuration**

Configuring VLANs and VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP).

Setting up a VTP server and multiple VTP clients.

VLAN propagation and verification across switches. 



**Activity 7** ‚Äì **Router on a Stick Configuration**

Inter-VLAN routing using a single router with sub-interfaces.

VLAN creation, trunking, and sub-interface configuration.

Successful end-to-end communication testing between VLANs. 



**üîπ Final Report**

Title: Enhancing Home Network Security in the Age of Ubiquitous Connectivity 


**This report explores:**

The security risks of modern home networks.

Current security features in commercial networking devices.

Best practices, advanced technologies (VPNs, IDS, AI-based security), and user awareness strategies to improve home network security.

The report provides an academic literature review, critical analysis, and practical recommendations for strengthening home network defenses.
